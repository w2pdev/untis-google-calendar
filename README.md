# Untis to Google-Calendar

a npm script to show your Untis contents in your Google Calendar.

### Usage
- fill your Untis Credentials, schoolcode and url into .env
- enter the Google-Calendar ID into .env
- Put the Credentials to your Google-Service-Account into 'service-account.json'
- npm run


### NOTE
This is just a fun project for my own use, hence the horrific code readability and structure.
